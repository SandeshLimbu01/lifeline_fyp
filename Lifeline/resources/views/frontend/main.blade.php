                        <h5 class="mb-3">Fuel your body with the nutrients it needs for a healthier you!</h5>

                        <p>Diet and nutrition refer to the food and nutrients that we consume to fuel our bodies and
                            maintain good health. A healthy diet includes a variety of foods from all food groups, such
                            as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Nutrients are
                            essential substances that our bodies need to function properly, and they come from the food
                            we eat.</p>

                        <p>A balanced diet provides all the necessary nutrients in the right proportions to meet our
                            body's needs. Some of the essential nutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, fats,
                            vitamins, minerals, and water. Carbohydrates provide energy, while proteins are important
                            for building and repairing muscles and tissues. Fats are important for insulation and
                            cushioning of our vital organs. Vitamins and minerals play a vital role in various bodily
                            functions, such as strengthening the immune system, bone health, and blood circulation.
                            Water is essential for the body to function properly and helps maintain hydration. </p>

                        <p>A healthy diet can help prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and
                            obesity. It can also help improve our mental and emotional well-being. On the other hand, a
                            poor diet can lead to malnutrition, weight gain, and chronic health problems.</p>

                        <p> It's important to consult a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to create
                            a
                            personalized nutrition plan based on individual needs and health conditions.</p>

                                hydration status. Clear or light-colored urine generally indicates adequate hydration,
                                while dark yellow or amber-colored urine may indicate dehydration.

                                    your diet to ensure you're getting a range of nutrients.</li>
                                <li>Choose whole grains over refined grains: Whole grains contain more fiber and
                                    nutrients than refined grains, which have been stripped of their bran and germ. Look
                                    for whole grain options such as brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread, and whole
                                    grain pasta.</li>
                                <li>Incorporate lean proteins: Proteins are important for building and repairing
                                    tissues, and can also help you feel fuller for longer. Choose lean protein sources
                                    such as chicken, fish, tofu, beans, and legumes.</li>
                                <li>Limit processed and sugary foods: Processed foods often contain high amounts of
                                    sodium, unhealthy fats, and added sugars, which can be detrimental to your health if
                                    consumed in excess. Limiting these types of foods can help you maintain a healthy
                                    diet.</li>
                                <li>Don't forget about healthy fats: Healthy fats, such as those found in nuts, seeds,
                                    avocado, and fatty fish, are essential for brain function and maintaining healthy
                                    skin, hair, and nails. Incorporating these foods into your diet can help you feel
                                    fuller for longer and provide important nutrients.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Find activities you enjoy: Regular physical activity can be more enjoyable when you
                                engage in activities that you find fun and enjoyable. Try different types of exercise
                                such as dancing, swimming, hiking, or cycling to find what you enjoy.</li>
                            <li>Set achievable goals: Setting realistic and achievable fitness goals can help keep you
                                motivated and on track. Start with small goals and gradually increase your activity
                                level over time.</li>
                            <li>Make it a habit: Incorporating physical activity into your daily routine can help make
                                it a habit. Try scheduling workouts at the same time each day or taking a daily walk
                                during your lunch break.</li>
                            <li>Get a workout buddy: Working out with a friend or family member can help keep you
                                motivated and make exercise more fun. Plus, you can hold each other accountable for
                                sticking to your fitness goals.</li>
                            <li>Take breaks and listen to your body: It's important to listen to your body and take
                                breaks when you need to. Pushing yourself too hard can lead to injury and burnout.
                                Remember to start slowly, gradually increasing your activity level, and taking breaks
                                when necessary to prevent overexertion.</li>
